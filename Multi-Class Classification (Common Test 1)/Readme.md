## Approaching the Task: 

1) Having a background in image classification and generation, It was easy to work with the dataset provided.
2) My first step was to take a look over the dataset provided in the problem statement and gather the relevant information regarding the three classes, strong lensing images with no substructure, subhalo substructure, and vortex substructure.
3) Secondly, I went onto study and analyse the model architecture and chose ResNet18 because of its vast usecase and high accuracy.
4) Lastly, I started implementing the code in my notebook taking reference from the implementations of a reference notebook created by ML4SCI in a hackathon, 3 years ago.

## Introduction to Strong Lensing Challenge - Multi-Class Classification:

Gravitational lensing has been a cornerstone in many cosmology experiments and studies since it was discussed in Einsteinâ€™s calculations back in 1936 and discovered in 1979, and one area of particular interest is the study of dark matter via substructure in strong lensing images. In this challenge, I focus on exploring the potential of supervised models in identifying dark matter based on simulated strong lensing images with different substructure.

This is an example notebook for the Multi-Class Classification Challenge. In this notebook, I demonstrate @ models:

1) A Base Resnet18 model implemented using the PyTorch library to solve the task.
2) A simple CNN model implemented using the PyTorch library to solve the task of multi-class classification of strong lensing images.

## Model Architecture:

### Residual Block
1) A basic building block used in ResNet, consisting of two convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation applied after each convolutional layer.
2) The input is added to the output of the second convolutional layer, allowing the model to learn residual mappings.
3) A downsample layer is applied to match the dimensions of the input and output.

### ResNet Model
1) Begins with a convolutional layer followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.
2) Max-pooling layer is applied.
3) Three layers of residual blocks are stacked, with different numbers of blocks in each layer.
4) An adaptive average pooling layer is applied to convert the spatial dimensions of the feature maps to 1x1.
5) Finally, a fully connected layer is used for classification.

### ResNet18 Model Instance
1) Created using the ResNet class with ResidualBlock as the basic block and a configuration of [2, 2, 2] for the number of blocks in each layer.
2) This follows the ResNet18 architecture, which consists of 2 blocks in each of the three layers.

## Working Methodology:

Implementing a DDPM model is simple. We define a model that takes two inputs: Images and the randomly sampled time steps. At each training step, we perform the following operations to train our model:

1) Sample random noise to be added to the inputs.
2) Apply the forward process to diffuse the inputs with the sampled noise.
3) Your model takes these noisy samples as inputs and outputs the noise prediction for each time step.
4) Given true noise and predicted noise, we calculate the loss values
5) We then calculate the gradients and update the model weights.

## Evaluation Metrics: 

1) In the ResNet18 Model, the value of RUC-AOC curve is very high, because of the complex model architecture.

2) The AUC score is very low here, since I have trained a basic CNN model.

## Possible Improvisations:

There are a few things that I can try to improve the model:

1) While ResNet18 is relatively shallow, deeper variants such as ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152 are commonly used for more complex tasks and datasets.

2) Augment training data with techniques like random rotations, flips, crops, and color jittering. This helps to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability.
